### Print ###

## Python 2 and 3 ##

# Unfortunately today there are two incompatible branches of Python language:
# version 2.7 and versions 3.*. The very first difference that you find is a
# print statement. In Python 2 print is literally a statement and should be used
# without parentheses:
# print 1
# will print '1'. Nowadays you should use Python 3 where print is a function
# (for now just believe there is a reason to be so):
# print(1)
# will print '1'. If you must use Python 2 or you write a library that should
# work on both 2 and 3 than you can use this "magic" line with __future__
# statement:

from __future__ import print_function, division

# We will describe import system later. This line has no effect in Python 3 but
# in Python 2 it sets behaviour of print statement to the same as in Python 3.
# This line should be the first meaningful line in your file.

# Now we are ready to print something:
print(1)  # Will print '1' without quotes

# Let's test simple arithmetic operations:
print(1 + 2)
# 3
print(3 - 4)
# -1
print(3 * (-5))
# -15
print(2 ** 10)
# 1024


### Numbers ###

## Integers ##

# Python supports long integers
print(1024 ** 128)
# 20815864389328798163850480654728171077230524494533409610638224700807216119346720596024478883464648369684843227908562015582767132496646929816279813211354641525848259018778440691546366699323167100945918841095379622423387354295096957733925002768876520583464697770622321657076833170056511209332449663781837603694136444406281042053396870977465916057756101739472373801429441421111406337458176

## Floats ##

# There are built-in floating point numbers (float for short):
print(1.23)
# 1.23
print(1e-3)
# 0.001
# Floats have limits:
print(1e200 * 1e200)
# inf

## Division ##

# Division (operator "/") works different in Python 2 and 3. In Python 2
# division of two integers is always integer but in Python 3 it is always
# float. "Magic" statement "from __future__ import division" above works in the
# very same way as for the print function described earlier and asks Python 2 to
# work as Python 3. Use it always if your code can be run with Python 2
# interpreter.

# Let's look how division works
print(1 / 2)
# 0.5
print(4 / 2)
# 2.0
print(1.5 / 0.5)
# 3.0

# Operator "//" returns an integer rounded to the smaller value. It returns an integer
# typed value for a pair of integers and a float typed value if at least one of
# the values is float:
print(1 // 2)
# 0
print(4.0 // 2)
# 2.0
print(1.5 // 0.4)
# 3.0

# Operator "%" returns the fractional part, the returned value is determined by the same
# laws as for "//".
print(1 % 2)
# 1
print(1.5 % 0.4)
# 0.29999999999999993

# Yes, Python has a common floating point arithmetic accuracy problem, see
# Wikipedia for details
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic#Accuracy_problems


## Complex numbers ##

# Python has a floating complex type:
print(2 + 3j)
# (2+3j)

# Where j is an imaginary unit modifier


### Variables and numerical types ###

## Dynamic type checking ##

# Python is a dynamic type checking language that means you don't need to declare
# variable before assignment. Also you can change the type of the variable after the
# first assignment
a = 10
print(a)
# 10
a = 10.0
print(a)
# 10.0

## Type conversions ##

# You can convert a variable from one type to another
a = 7
b = complex(7)
print(b)
# (7+0j)
a = 13.2
b = int(a)
print(b)
# 13

## Attributes and methods ##

# Python is an object oriented language and each variable is represented by an
# object of some type (class). We will describe how to create our own classes
# later. Now the only thing that we should now is that classes and therefore
# objects have attributes and methods (functions). Syntax of an attribute access is
# the same as in a lot of other languages via "." separator.
a = (-1 + 0j)**(-0.5)  # "+ 0j" is needed only in Python 2
print(a.imag)
# -1.0
print(a.conjugate().imag)
# 1.0

## Type of the variable ##

# Built-in function "type" returns object type
print(type(1))
# <class 'int'>
# Full list of built-in functions can be found on
# https://docs.python.org/library/functions.html


### If-else and bool ###

## If-elif-else ##

# If statement is as simple as
a = 4
if a > 3:
    print(a)
else:
    print(0)
# 4

# Pay attention to the colon and that blocks inside if-else statement are shifted. 

if a < 0:
    print(-a)
else:
    if a > 0:
        print(a)
    else:
        print(0)
# 4

# You can combine else: if: statements into one elif statement:
if a < 0:
    print(-a)
elif a > 0:
    print(a)
else:
    print(0)
# 4

## Indentation ##

# Indention is a part of Python language. You should always use one type of
# indention: # spaces or tabs. Otherwise interpreter will fail with an
# IndentationError error. PEP 8 (style guide for Python code,
# http://pep8.org/#indentation) recommends to use 4 spaces per each indention
# level. I will try to follow PEP 8 in this course.

# However sometimes indent means nothing
a = (1
     + 2
    - 3j)
print(a)
# (3-3j)

## Boolean type variables and Boolean value of variables ##

# At fact we have already met Boolean variables above inside if statement.
print(1 > 0)
# True
print(1 == 0)
# False
a = 0.5
print(a > 0 and a < 1)
# True

# Is the same as
print(0 < a < 1)
# True
print(a < 0 or a > 1)
# False
b = a < 0 or a > 1
b = not b
print(b)
# True

# Each variable has a Boolean value that used by the if to decide what to do. You can
# obtain this Boolean value by built-in bool function:
print(bool(0+1j))
# True
print(bool(0))
# False


### While loop ###

# While statement is as simple as if
a = 0
s = 0
while a < 10:
    s += a
    a += 1
print(s)
# 45

## Continue and break statements ##

# You can skip a step of a loop using continue statement:
a = 0
s = 0
while a < 10:
    a += 1
    if a % 2 == 1:
        continue
    s += a
print(a, s)
# 10 30

# You can exit infinite loop using break statement:
a = 0
s = 0
while True:
    s += a
    a += 1
    if s > 1024:
        break
print(s)
# 1035
# This is an artificial example but pay attention how to make an infinite loop.

## while and else together ##

# If use want to catch break from while (or for) loop use while-else:
a = 0
while a < 10:
    a += 1
    b = a * 2
    if b > 20:
        print(b)
        break
else:
    print(20)
# 20

a = 0
while a < 10:
    a += 1
    b = a * 2
    if b > 10:
        print(b)
        break
else:
    print(10)
# 12    

# This syntax should be preferred to using boolean flag.
